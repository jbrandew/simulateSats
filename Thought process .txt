Simulation Structure Construction

Non ML Dynamic Routing for packets and topology changes:
 


Questions: 
is there an analogous algorithm from OSPF for instead changes in topology over time? 
i guess, what results in a change in topology? 
	-each server periodically updates adjacent servers with routing table/graph information
	-based on some threshold distance, works to change topology 


Dynamic Source Routing: 
-soure routing: original sender decides path
-adaptively allows connections to form .... (on demand) 


partly distributed/centralized
try fully centralized/fully distributed 
-mention splits the difference (allowing other models existence) 

federated learning vs centralized RL -> updates submodels...
will compare fully each 

test methods with static toplogy (ex. 4 nearest neighbors) 


visualization on state/rewards
(state info/action/location

show equations in context of images/where theyre performing/operating


cell coverage work/beam angle work....
-definitely need in action sppace, how to cover
-beam small vs big -> harder to handle demand
	-beam small -> bigger rate, smaller place...

-fixed beam size -> what cells are each going to cover 
-can avoid RF interference problem for now...
-some notion of how to decide each....

-how our RL framework addresses these things 
-possibly just extension...., but different variables, harder to optimize over

explain relation to other papers
explain what a non fair solution look like and why is that a problem
	-need uniform converage 
	-pointing that out in the importance of fairness
