why optimizing metrics (in general why a priority/problem) 
definitely go into more of reasoning behind distributed vs centralized approach

more just general contextualization 

comparison in reactivity ability in this scheme vs others
-dynamic traffic events/outages 
-@ context possible weaknesses 

look into reward approaches
-cite existing work for RL space for their reward approaches
-in general more grounding for RL reward creation, especially wireless app.

more context of why we are even using RL in this 
-(as distributed/local info)
-complexity of modeling as a whole 

have RL adaptive topology changes rather than scheduled consideration
-forgetting previous delay distributions 
-testing method for robustness against weaknesses such as cata. forgetting
-specifically for Q networks 

dimensionality vs forgetfulness weakness 
-discuss tradeoff
LEO context 

figure edit for outcomes 
slight spiecifc tasks

cone coverage with ISL switching -> multi regional converage -> etc. 
-examine increase in compelxity and convergenc
