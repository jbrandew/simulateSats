Have modified adjacency matrix that has value for each node, representing additional distance to all other nodes in which that node is connected to. (So like for processing time/q-ing delay at a satellite)
^ nah, just have an additional "wait time" for each, and create additional parameter within dijkstraWithPath for the server waits :D 


how effectively "dynamic" our policy is can greatly depend on the saturation of the network...too much, and it wont matter. too little, and gradients are too small, etc.
